# Title: 
Customer Churn Prediction in TelCo

# Description: 
Predicting customer churn using the Adaboost classifier in the use case of Telecomunications industry.

# Abstract of the project:
The Customer Churn measure refers to the probability that current customers of a company stop using 
its services for different reasons, for example because they switch to rivalry companies. The prior 
forecasting of a customer churn can be used to prevent customer/revenue loss by reacting on time to the situation, 
for instance by launching marketing campaigns or other type of “bribing” the customer to remain (retention measures).
Customer churn is present in almost each industry specially in the service ones: such as banking, 
insurances and telecommunication. Specially in telecommunication services is an important factor to 
consider due to the flexibility characteristic of this field. This project predicts user churn using 
supervised methods (winner: Adaboost classifier) and analyses the use case of TelCo user churn.
